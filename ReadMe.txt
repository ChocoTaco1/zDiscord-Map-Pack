Discord Map Pack
Readme

Late 2020

	This map pack was put together over the span of a few months off-and-on for the server Discord PUB.
Some maps are from other mappacks and some maps were made from scratch. This map pack also includes 10 
original maps from Rooster128. With these main "focus maps", there are "Xtra" maps packaged in the xtra 
missions folder inside the vl2. These are here at the server owners pleasure to run them or not. Also 
included are xtra terrains, xtra maps, xtra assets, skies, textures, sounds, skins, and retextured assets.
This extra content is to be kind of a future-proof for the server, offering future map makers content 
to make even more serverside maps one day.

	The ten new original maps from Rooster were made almost completely using original assets. Some of these
maps are just a few months old- other maps are older maps that, for one reason or another, just never saw the
light of day, and wound up collecting dust on his hard drive until now. The new maps were created in the spirit 
of this map pack- to give other mappers more assets to work with. Particular attention was given to the terrains 
to ensure they were challenging- but not too challenging, smooth- but not too smooth. The Rooster originals are 
almost completely devoid of vehicles (sorry Gooners)- standalone vehicles have been included in a few maps.

	The process of making this map pack also included looking through old mappacks and looking for fresh
ideas. There's already a ton of good maps in T2- its hard to do anything different that hasn't already been 
done. A lot of these maps were ok-ish in their original forms and had potential- these maps were polished and
refined into something hopefully people may enjoy. A lot of the textures were taken from texture projects of 
other games and converted to work with T2. There are a lot of decent assets people have made that 
are included in this pack- hopefully someone can find a use for them in the future.

	Using and finding assets in this pack can be done by loading the mapassets map in the xtra 
missions folder for quick reference. If you find an asset you like, pair it with a common terrain 
used in the game or any s5, s8, twl, twl2, dmp terrain respectively. Anything you create will now load 
for other clients without requiring them to download anything. Go nuts! Choosing a sky will 
involve choosing sky in the editor ( Alt+E ) and putting in whatever.dml. You can find selectable 
dml files in the textures folder.
